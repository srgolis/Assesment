Build the Docker image:
Make sure you have Docker installed. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing your app.py and Dockerfile, and run:


docker build -t my-flask-api .


Run the Docker container:
Once the image is built, you can run the container:

docker run -p 5000:5000 my-flask-api

Now, your Flask app with CRUD operations is running inside a Docker container. You can access the API at http://localhost:5000.
